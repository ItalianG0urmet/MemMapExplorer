# 🛠️ MemDumper

**MemDumper** is a utility to dump files used by any application in Linux. It relies on the `/proc/` directory, which is native to Linux, to obtain this information.
( This program is not complete and is still in the alpha stage. )

## 🚀 Usage

To use the application, you will need to know the PID of the program you wish to dump. Once you have the PID, you can run the following command: 
```bash
$ ./dumper -p <pid>
```

- **Find string**: Identify a defined string in the process dump.  
- **Deleted Files View**: Display only files that are no longer present in the filesystem.
